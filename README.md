<h1>SR9011 vs AC262,536: Which One's Worth It?</h1>

<p>After testing dozens of SARMs and research compounds over the years, I finally ran a solo cycle of <strong>SR9011</strong> and compared it head-to-head with <strong>AC262,536</strong>. Both of these are non-hormonal (or close to it), but they work in very different ways. Here’s what happened when I tested both — the results, the side effects, and which one’s worth buying.</p>

<h2>What Are These Compounds?</h2>

<h3>SR9011</h3>
<p>SR9011 is a REV-ERB agonist. That means it helps regulate your circadian rhythm and metabolic activity. It’s not technically a SARM, but it’s often used like one. It increases energy, endurance, and fat loss — without any androgenic effects.</p>

<h3>AC262,536</h3>
<p>AC262,536 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) designed to target muscle growth while avoiding organs like the prostate. It’s one of the mildest SARMs I’ve used, but also one of the cleanest. Great for beginners or people who want less suppression.</p>

<h2>My Testing Method</h2>

<p>I ran both of these solo in separate cycles, each for 6 weeks with a 4-week break in between. No stacks. Same diet, training, and sleep tracking. I paid attention to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Energy levels and mood</li>
  <li>Fat loss</li>
  <li>Muscle retention</li>
  <li>Side effects (libido, sleep, heart rate)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>My SR9011 Experience</h2>

<p>I ran SR9011 at 30mg/day, split into two doses (morning and mid-afternoon). The first thing I noticed: I had way more energy during the day. No caffeine needed. I felt like I was in fat-burning mode 24/7. Resting heart rate stayed low, but I was more active and alert.</p>

<p>Body fat dropped noticeably by week 3. I wasn’t losing strength either — which surprised me. It felt like cardio-in-a-pill. Great for cutting, but not ideal for bulking.</p>

<p>Downside? You have to dose it 2–3 times daily because of the short half-life. Also, it can mess with sleep if taken too late in the day.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Fat loss, energy, cutting, endurance</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 30mg/day (15mg AM / 15mg PM)</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Burns fat fast without cardio</li>
  <li>Huge energy boost</li>
  <li>No testosterone suppression</li>
  <li>Improves endurance and stamina</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short half-life, multiple doses per day</li>
  <li>Can disrupt sleep if taken late</li>
  <li>No real muscle-building effect</li>
</ul>

<h2>My AC262,536 Experience</h2>

<p>I took AC262,536 at 30mg/day for 6 weeks. It took a bit longer to feel it — about 2.5 weeks — but the results were smoother. I held onto lean mass and got a nice recomp effect. Vascularity improved, and I felt drier, tighter, and lighter by the end of the cycle.</p>

<p>Biggest win: <strong>No suppression</strong> — or at least so mild I didn’t notice. No drop in libido, mood, or strength. It felt almost like a natural booster that actually worked.</p>

<p>If you’re cutting or just want to look cleaner without blowing up or shutting down your system, AC262,536 is a solid pick.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Recomp, cutting, natural-looking gains</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 30mg/day (once daily)</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/ac-262-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AC262,536 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lean, dry muscle gains</li>
  <li>Minimal suppression</li>
  <li>Great for recomposition</li>
  <li>Once-daily dosing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Slower results</li>
  <li>Not ideal for heavy bulking</li>
</ul>

<h2>SR9011 vs AC262,536: My Take</h2>

<p>Both compounds are great — but for totally different goals. If I had to break it down simply:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Go with SR9011</strong> if your main goal is <strong>fat loss, endurance, and energy</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Go with AC262,536</strong> if you want a <strong>mild recomp, lean gains, and no suppression</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these will bulk you up fast like RAD-140 or LGD-4033, but both are safer and smoother. Personally, I use SR9011 when cutting hard, and AC262,536 during lean phases or cruise periods.</p>
